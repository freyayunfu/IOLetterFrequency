Layer 1 Policy IssuesWhat happened?CityNet is the Trustee-Manager of NetLink TrustNetLink Trust DivestmentTo enhance CityNet’s independence, SingTel will divest more than 75 per cent of its holdings in NetLink Trust by April 2018.Effective Open AccessNon-discriminatory and non-exclusive access to all segments of the network through structural and/or operational separation and interconnection requirementsSingTel will also cease its role as the subcontractor hired by OpenNet to lay the fibre cables and connect customers to the network.One entity - NetLink Trust - will in future have control over all the various steps involved in connecting users to the networkBuilding the fibre and owning the manholes and ducts along which it travels, to deploying the manpower needed to roll it out to buildings and homes.This is why consumers can expect "more operational efficiencies" and "one point of accountability" if the deal goes through, said Mr Yap Chee Keong, chairman of CityNet, the trustee-manager of NetLink Trust.These "improved efficiencies" will filter down to customers who want to connect their homes or offices to the ultra-fast network, Mr Yap told reporters on Thursday.How did Netlink Trust come about?SingTel won its bid in 2008 as part of the OpenNet consortiumSingtel was then required to set up an independent asset company NetLink Trust as part of conditions to ensure fair competitionNetLink Trust will take over Singtel assets such as ducts, manholes and exchanges.Having access to these assets speeds up the network rollout, allowing 3rd parties to start services.In addition, SingTel was bound to sell down its stake in NetLink Trust by April 2014 to under 25 percent. Singtel is now allowed to delay this until 2018.“The terms, conditions and prices of OpenNet's services are, and will continue to be, regulated by the IDA” - Jacqueline Ong, acting CEO of CityNetManages physical assets and infrastructure related to NGNBN for SingtelA 25-year duct and manhole services agreement relating to SingTel’s existing copper and fibre cables situated within the NetLink Trust ducts. The fees payable by SingTel under this agreement are approximately SGD 20 million per annum.A duct and manhole services agreement relating to OpenNet’s fibre cables situated within the NetLink Trust ducts. Under this agreement, SingTel will pay a fixed charge, as well as a variable charge comprising 70 percent of the variable charge that SingTel receives from OpenNet. The fixed charge is estimated at SGD 5 million and 15 million for the financial years ending 31 March 2012 and 2013. With effect from the financial year ending 31 March 2014, the fixed charge is expected to be SGD 20 million per annum.Long-term property lease agreements in relation to the lease of space by SingTel in the seven exchange buildings which form part of the assets. The amount payable by SingTel under these agreements is approximately SGD 12 million per annum.Long-term property lease agreements in relation to the lease of approximately 120 square metres of space each in two exchange buildings by CityNet in its capacity as trustee-manager of NetLink Trust.-- Being a NetCo --QoS standards: OpenNet must connect 98 per cent of residential sign-ups within three working days of receiving their orders each month. The rest of the requests have to be fulfilled within seven working days.For business users, OpenNet must connect 80 per cent of new sign-ups within four weeks of the order date, and the remaining 20 per cent within eight weeks.IDA can impose a fine of S$10,000 (US$8,022) per breach each month, with additional penalties for serious breaches, or continuing or repeated breaches.-- Bukit Panjang Fire Incident --CAUSEAn unauthorised blowtorch was used to heat and shrink a thermo fit to seal a cable duct. The flame of the unauthorised blowtorch was almost twice as hot as that of a SingTel-issued blowtorch.IDA has found the following parties had not fulfilled their respective obligationsSingapore Telecommunications Limited (“SingTel”), CityNet Infrastructure Management Pte Ltd (“CityNet”) OpenNet Pte Ltd (“OpenNet”)Likely failure of SingTel worker to observe a full 30-minute fire watch: This was required under SingTel’s and CityNet’s SOPs.No re-activation of the fire alarm when SingTel’s worker left the Exchange’s cable chamber unattended during his lunch, which was not in accordance with the SOPs.The fire alarm had been deactivated prior to hot works in accordance with SingTel and CityNet’s SOPs, as smoke from such works could trigger false alarms.No proper supervision of the hot works by CityNet or SingTel on 9 October 2013.IDA also found a piece of material in the vicinity of the fire (i.e., a small burnt piece of cardboard) which should not have been present, indicating that there could be other possible materials contributing to the fire.SingTel’s Business Continuity Management (BCM) did not have specific contingency plans to address serious service outage situations of such a scale as the Bukit Panjang incident.The use of flame and lead sealants in the cable chamber is an outdated and hazardous practice, and is not in line with industry best practices and standards.Eight out of the 53 fibre cable rings connecting through the Exchange were temporarily routed using one single cable entry point, representing a single point of failure for that Exchange.IDA has found SingTel to be in breach of the Code of Practice for Telecommunication Service Resiliency 2008 (“Service Resiliency Code”). Under the Telecommunications Act (Cap. 323) (“TA”), IDA may impose a financial penalty of up to 10% of a licensee’s annual gross turnover (“AGTO”), or S$1 million, whichever is higher.IDA imposed a financial penalty of S$6 million on SingTelSome of the commitments SingTel made include: (i) replacing lead duct seals in exchanges with the Multi Cable Transit system which does not require heating; (ii) installation of automatic fire suppression systems within cable chambers in all its exchanges; (iii) centralised monitoring of smoke detectors and fire alarms; (iv) enhancing the physical security of cable chambers, in particular, installing CCTVs to prevent unauthorised access; and (v) enhancing its Operations Support System and processes to ensure compliance to fibre path diversity requirements for enterprise customers with redundancy and path diversity needs.Some of the commitments CityNet made include: (i) replacing the lead duct seals in all cable chambers; (ii) installing gas suppression systems and more fire extinguishers in all cable chambers; (iii) installing a centralised alarm monitoring system to monitor critical building alarms, including smoke detectors (and other fire warning alarm systems); and (iv) installing an electronic access system, together with CCTVs located at the entrance of each cable chamber.IDA is also looking into the need for greater network monitoring capability across the multi-layered network infrastructure to enhance the overall resiliency of the NBN.IDA has embarked on a review of the resilience of all critical parts of Singapore’s infocomm infrastructure and the review is expected to be completed in the second half of 2014KEY TAKEAWAY:The then-arrangement of OpenNet using subcontracters like Singtel to carry out maintenance work displayed its drawbacks during the fire.This prompted IDA to approve a Singtel’s OpenNet Acquisition, and the consolidation of responsibilities into a single party called NetLink Trust. NetLink Trust will both own and carry out maintainence work on the NGNBN infrastructure. Any disasters that strike any of the exchanges in the future will solely be attributable to NetLink Trust. LAYER 3 – PAY TVNationwide Subscription TV License: industry players must provide services that reach over 100,000 subscribers.Niche Subscription TV License: niche players offering IPTV services which have a limited reach of fewer than 100,000 subscribers. These licensees would be subject to a "lighter" license framework, according to the MDA. Niche licensees, for example, will not be required to carry local free-to-air channels.The Media Development Authority (MDA) has fined SingTel S$180,000 for a disruption to its mio TV service on 13 May 2012.An island-wide disruption affected some 115,000 mio TV subscribers who were tuning-in to the concluding matches of the 2011/2012 Barclays Premier League (BPL) season on 13 May 2012Viewers experienced reception issues including intermittent screen freezes and blurred images from 10.15pm onwards. Full service quality was only restored at around 12.15am after the televised matches concluded.Investigations traced the cause of the service disruption to the higher level of channel switching activity among subscribers while viewing the live BPL matches, which led to network congestion and resulted in reception difficulties for the subscribers.SingTel in 2010 won the bid for the exclusive rights to broadcast three season of the EPL on its pay TV platform, mio TV, But in the process drove up subscription costs for consumers.The Cross Carriage RuleFrom 1 August 2011, pay TV retailers who have acquired any exclusive content on or after 12 March 2010 (Qualified Content) must widen the distribution of such content I.e. by offering it to other subscribers through the set-top boxes of qualified pay TV retailers. The Measure is aimed at fostering a vibrant pay TV market to the benefit of consumers and industry.Consumers who wish to subscribe to Qualified Content must be able to receive it within 5 working days of initiating the request with their respective pay TV retailers.All Qualified Content must be cross-carried in its entirety and in an unmodified and unedited form. This ensures a homogenous and consistent viewer experience for the consumer regardless of the viewing platform used to view the content.Pay TV retailers are required to deal with customer feedback or complaints on a non-discriminatory basis.Pay TV retailers are required to publish and maintain a list of Qualified Content on their respective websites and viewing guides to ensure that consumers have access to adequate information on Qualified Content.Pay TV retailers offering Qualified Content to customers must do so at the same price, terms and conditions as that offered to their own subscribers.Singtel began sharing its English Premier League (EPL) broadcasts with rival StarHub under the Media Development Authority's (MDA) cross-carriage ruleSingTel's mioTV service uses Internet Protocol television (IPTV) technology and requires a subscriber's box to be authenticated by the network before content is streamed across.StarHub's system works differently - its signals are encrypted and broadcast instead, which means illegal boxes can simply decode StarHub's signals and allow users to view all 100-plus channels without having to pay a monthly subscription in some instances. Illegal decoders sold online cost between $150 and $250 Bibliography
